# DJANGO-PROJECTS

I have created 2 intermediate level DJANGO-PROJECTS on LIBRARY MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCT MANAGEMENT where the user can create his own account and login to add books, or product, even remove them or edit their details,
and we on the backend team can retrieve data from the user.

The following Projects added here demonstrate the use of it.
